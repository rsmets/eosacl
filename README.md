Online identity is in the hands of each service provider (Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Chase Bank, etc) and users authentication credentials are used to have temporary access to those identities or accounts. If one of those services leaks account credentials, our service identity integrity is ruined. Additionally, if an inside malicious actor wants to impersonate an account, the capabilities for doing so are present. The blind trust users must put into service providers should not be required. Users should be in full control of their online identities. 

With new decentralized technologies that leverage asymmetric cryptography characteristics, users can now control their online identities. Using the latest of this technology allows for application developers access to decentralized compute platforms, capable of supporting significant real-world applications at scale. 

This was an EOS dapp deployed to main under the name, myeosacldapp which addresses the issues mentioned above.
